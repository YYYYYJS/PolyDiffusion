# LayoutDiffusion

 Our code is developed based on the **LayoutDiffusion** project, which can be found at [LayoutDiffusion GitHub](https://github.com/ZGCTroy/LayoutDiffusion). We have extended and improved upon this framework to enable more precise control over multi-object generation and other functionalities. While modifying and optimizing the original code, we have maintained the core structure and framework of **LayoutDiffusion**. We appreciate the foundational work provided by the **LayoutDiffusion** project and encourage others to use and further enhance our code. We welcome any feedback and contributions.# PolyDiffusion
